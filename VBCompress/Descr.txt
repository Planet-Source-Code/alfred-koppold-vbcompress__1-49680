This class uses the compression-method from microsofts compress.exe and expand.exe.
This compressed files are often with "_" on the end ("setup.tx_" ...) 
The method is full compatible.
You can compress with my app (class) and expand with expand.exe or compress with compress.exe and expand with my app.
I include the api-version of expand. A compression is not in the api.
I compress Win32api.txt from 652 kb to 196 kb.
But: Sometimes the compressed file is bigger then the sourcefile!!!
Test it. Some sort of files (txt...) are better to compress as other files (exe...) - they are really smaller. 
A file from 11 MBytes took 30 seconds to compress on my old 500 MHz PC.

To use my class is very simple:
Dim a as new clsCompress

a.Compress filename to sourcefilename, filename of the compressed file

a.Expand sourcefilename, filename of the expanded file

a.ExpandWithAPI sourcefilename, filename of the expanded file


or you can do the same with:
Dim a as new clsCompress
a.Loadfilename = sourcefilename
a.savefilename = filename of the compressed (expanded) file
a.compress (or a. expand)
